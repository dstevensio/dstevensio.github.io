AOP = Aspect Oriented Programming

Application Composition

Aspect: encapsulated units of behavior
AOP: putting them together to make a program

AOP - controlled, non-invasive (don't change source code of aspect)

logging, profiling, memoization

the more dependencies you have, the harder it is to test a specific component

composition plan
