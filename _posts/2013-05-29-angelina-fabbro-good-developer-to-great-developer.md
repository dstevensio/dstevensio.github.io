No niceties at the beginning, just got straight to the point (that's a good
thing) - "No one is special". Good message: no such thing as purely natural
innate talent for programming, environmental issues will always contribute to
making you more or less likely to want to code, or be able to.

When you begin is also not an overriding factor on your ability to be an
"expert"

How to know not a beginner?
1. You can use fundamentals in any language
2. Comfortable writing code from scratch (not a library like jQuery etc)
(copy/paste/assemble from other code is important step on the journey)
3. Peeking inside libraries you use to see what makes them tick
4. You feel like your code is mediocre but don't know what to do about it

How do you know you are not expert?
1. Don't quite understand everything you read in code of others
2. Can't explain what you know - can't put what you're doing in to words, can
achieve it in code but explaining WHY or HOW is difficult
(Very important to have this skill)
3. Not confident debugging
4. You rely on references too much - looking back to references like web
documentation, api documentation, etc online very regularly, not writing much
from memory / muscle memory.

This = "Ambigious zone of intermediateness"

What makes great programmer?
- Ed Weissman good writer on the subject, google him
- Depends who is asking (what is the person looking for in the programmer?
  Getting it done? Doing it quickly? Writing the best code? etc)

What do you need to learn to be an expert?
1. Ask "why?" Obsessively. Work out why everything is the case, why did I make
this choice, why am I doing it this way? Tackle the problems that you used the
solutions for rather than patching
2. Teach/Speak at an event - good reflection on your own opinion of your
ability. Get asked compelling questions - either expose that you know stuff you
didn't realize, or help you discover what you don't know (or don't know well
enough)
3. Recommends [Learning advanced javascript (John Resig)](http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/) - became Secrets of the JS Ninja (book)
4.Experiment recklessly - do things to see what happens, doesn't matter what
happens
5. Have opinions - and express them - take a stand if you feel strongly about
them but be reasonable in discussing them and accept you could be wrong
6. Seek mentorship - look for those who know the subject better than you and
talk to them regularly, ask questions, show them what you're doing andtÂ·
7. Program alot!
8. Take breaks from programming sometimes! Time away is important
9. Write a lot of JS
10. Write in another language for a bit to expand thinking, exercise the brain
11. Think like a programmer when you're not programming - thought exercises to
optimize routes to work etc
12. Known what good feedback is, reject everything that is not good feedback -
"Haters gonna hate" - value the good feedback always!
13. Break free of imposters syndrome - if you write code, you are a programmer
stop saying you're not "really" a programmer because you're not resig/isaac/etc - focus on improvement
14. Fall in love with your process - how you code, how you interact, how you
talk about it.
