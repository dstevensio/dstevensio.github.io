Surface pro comes with radio tip - pixel perfect accuracy, tilt, pressure, etc - input devices are not just mouse + touch

Touch matters: proliferation of touch devices (25% win 8 devices, smartphones, chromebook pixel)

Strategies: ignore/retrofit/design for touch
Mouse emulation is often "good enough" to do nothing in some cases

Mouse: singular, touch: multiple

Recommends designing for touch 1st

Don't use hover!

Sizing for touch (11mm avg human finger tip)

Ergonomics- think of position of user and environment

Touch hotspots - where will they naturally touch, reach of thumbs/ fingers
Interaction areas: near edges. Reading areas: top/center

Pointer events capture all input device interactions

Poly fills:
Hand.js
Points.js
