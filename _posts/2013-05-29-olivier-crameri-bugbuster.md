Olivier was presenting Bugbuster, a "software robot" to help with testing your
application code.

Trying to fix the issue of writing code -> write more code to test your code

Essentially an API that gets out of the way - gives you the tools to test
without having to write too much more code to get testing.

There's a free beta available now at [bugbuster.com](http://bugbuster.com) -
though obviously you'll need to have your code at a publicly available URL so
that it can access it.

Performs auto-discovery - you give it the starting point of your app and it
discovers inputs, interactions, etc without being explicitly told.

API seems intuitive and not convoluted.
