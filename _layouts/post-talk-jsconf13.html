<h2>JSConf 2013</h2>
<p>
  This is a quick summary of a talk I attended at <a
    href="http://2013.jsconf.us">JSConf 2013</a>. You can <a
    href="/jsconf-2013-talks-list">see a list
  of all those I've summarized notes from here</a>. There's also a <a
  href="/general-thoughts-during-jsconf-2013">General thoughts during
  JSConf 2013</a> post for all the non-talk bits and pieces.
</p>
<p>
  There were 3 concurrent tracks at the conference, so only those I attended
  myself are summarized here. Other attendees have summarized some of the talks I didn't get to due
  to scheduling conflicts - you can find those at <a
    href="http://jlongster.com/My-JSConf-Diary">jlongster.com (James Long)</a> and <a
    href="https://github.com/airportyh/jsconf13notes">Toby Ho's github
  repo</a>.
