<h2>JSConf 2013</h2>
<p>
  There were 3 concurrent tracks at the conference, so only those I attended
  myself are summarized here. Other attendees have summarized some of the talks I didn't get to due
  to scheduling conflicts - you can find those at <a
    href="http://jlongster.com/My-JSConf-Diary">jlongster.com (James Long)</a> and <a
    href="https://github.com/airportyh/jsconf13notes">Toby Ho's github
  repo</a>.
