<h2>Startup Security</h2>
<p>
  Application Security is often an afterthought or something that startups and small businesses plan to tackle later on
  in their lifecycle, assuming that they are at little risk while they are still bootstrapping and growing.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, the risk begins the moment code hits production, and a Security Breach early in the life of a new company
  can spell disaster for user/customer trust. Furthermore, many established security services are priced well outside the
  budget of most small businesses and startups.
</p>
<p>
  Working with some former colleagues, coming from a position working in Application Security, I have the goal of providing
  Application Security Reviews, Code Reviews and a combination of Scanning and Manual testing, at an affordable price for
  everyone trying to make their own way in the world with their entrepreneurial spirit.
