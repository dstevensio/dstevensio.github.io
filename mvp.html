<h2>MVP Creation</h2>
<p>
  There are millions of ideas out there and a massive shortage of developers. Finding someone to be a founding developer
  to get your idea implemented is extremely difficult.
</p>
<p>
  It's much easier to demonstrate your idea to developers, investors and most importantly, potential customers/users if
  you have a working MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that illustrates what you're solving.
</p>
<p>
  What I can offer is a limited-time engagement (i.e. we agree what will constitute the working features of your MVP,
  then agree the time it will take to create it) for a fixed project price (agreed before we begin). You don't give up
  any equity or ownership, everything we create is yours, and once the MVP is completed, you can then go out and build
  your permanent team, with my involvement ending (though further maintenance or development can be arranged at an
  additional cost by request).
